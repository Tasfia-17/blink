## What It Is (2-5 sentences)

**Vibe Check** is a mood-aware task dashboard that asks "How's your energy right now?" and shows you only the tasks that match your current state. When you're 🔥 Energized, it surfaces high-energy creative work. When you're 😴 Drained, it shows low-effort admin tasks. The entire UI theme dynamically shifts colors and gradients based on your selected vibe, creating an empathetic relationship with your work. It gamifies productivity with XP, levels, and bonus multipliers for completing tasks in matching energy states.

## Why It Exists

Traditional task managers treat you like a productivity robot—showing all 47 tasks with equal weight, regardless of whether you're caffeinated at 9am or exhausted at 4pm. **Vibe Check acknowledges you're human with fluctuating energy levels** and adapts your task list accordingly. It's the internal dashboard I wish existed for managing my own work.

## The Fun Part

The UI literally has emotional intelligence. Select "Energized" and watch the entire interface transform into fiery reds and oranges. Switch to "Calm" and it becomes soothing blues. The color psychology matches your mental state, making task management feel less like a chore and more like a personalized experience. Plus, the XP system with combo multipliers turns boring productivity into a game.

## The Unique Twist

Most task managers optimize for **organization**. Vibe Check optimizes for **execution**.

It's the first task manager that acknowledges you're not a constant—you're a variable. Your energy fluctuates throughout the day, and your tools should adapt to that reality, not ignore it.
