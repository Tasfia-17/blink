Subject: Blink - Progress Telerik UI Generator Challenge Submission

Dear Alyssa,

I'm excited to submit "Blink" for the Progress Telerik UI Generator Challenge.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Blink is a minimal thought-capture web app that reduces note-taking friction 
to under 3 seconds. It demonstrates how Kendo UI for React can power fast, 
consumer-focused experiences beyond traditional enterprise dashboards.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:
• 87% faster than traditional note apps (3s vs 23s)
• Uses 6 Kendo UI components creatively
• 100% local storage (privacy-first)
• Keyboard-first design
• Professional documentation with 8 custom SVG diagrams

TECH STACK:
• React 19.2 + TypeScript 5.9
• Kendo UI for React 14.2
• Tailwind CSS 4.2
• Framer Motion 12.34

REPOSITORY: [Your GitHub URL]
LIVE DEMO: [Your Demo URL]
DOCUMENTATION: See README.md for comprehensive details

The project showcases how Kendo UI components (Dialog, Window, Drawer, 
Notification, Input, Button) can be stripped down and recombined into 
something that feels like a native desktop utility.

Thank you for considering my submission!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Email]
```
